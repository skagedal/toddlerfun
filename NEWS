Toddler Fun 0.1
===============

This is based on Emmanuel GARETTE's program Gamine 1.1, but most of
the code is rewritten. These are the changes relative to Gamine:

* Line color is cycled through the colors of the rainbow instead of
  randombly chosen.

* On button press, a random cute SVG image is drawn.  A matching sound
  is played.

* Drawing content is slowly faded away.

* When clearing window, it fades away quickly.

* Kaleidoscopic mode: add mirrors with scroll wheel or key Up/Down

* GTK+ 3 is used.

* Drawing to an offscreen surface; this means messages can be
  displayed above drawing and when image is saved, only image is
  saved.

* GNU Autotools are used. 

* Commandline options allow setting of no fullscreen mode, turning off
  background music and sound effects.

* SVG images and sounds are bundled together in a "theme": a future
  version might allow user to choose between different themes.

* GConf configuration no longer available - future version should have
  a "parental console" where settings can be made. 

* Simpler code is used to go to fullscreen mode - this might lose
  functionality (unsure what?), but I've experienced some strange X
  errors upon exiting gamine previously.
